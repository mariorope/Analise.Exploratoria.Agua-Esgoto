<h3>Title: Comprehensive Exploration: Sanitation Conditions Across Brazilian States</h3>

**Introduction:**

<p align="justify">This project delves into an in-depth exploratory analysis of sanitation data across the diverse states of Brazil. The primary aim was to unveil insights into the relationship between the population served with water supply and sanitary sewage, while also considering the demographic variations across states.</p>

**Objective:**

<p align="justify">The overarching goal of this project was to conduct a detailed examination of sanitation conditions in Brazil, leveraging data visualization techniques to uncover patterns and disparities. A key focus was the creation of a scatter plot, illustrating the correlation between the proportion of the population served with water supply and sanitary sewage, with states represented by different colors and the size of dots reflecting population size. Additionally, supplementary analyses, predominantly graphical in nature, were conducted to provide further insights.</p>

**Data Source:**

<p align="justify">The dataset utilized in this project was extracted from the National Confederation of Municipalities (CNM) (<a href="https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/" target="_blank">https://www.cnm.org.br</a>), providing a comprehensive overview of sanitation conditions across Brazilian states. The data's credibility and relevance contribute significantly to the robustness of the analysis.</p>

**Methodology:**

<p align="justify">Throughout the project, a meticulous step-by-step approach was adopted to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Each stage of the analysis, from data preprocessing to visualization, was thoroughly explained, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies employed. By elucidating the procedures undertaken, this project serves as a valuable resource for individuals seeking to replicate or build upon the findings presented.</p>

**Key Findings:**

<p align="justify">The exploratory analysis revealed intriguing insights into the disparities in sanitation conditions across Brazilian states. The scatter plot highlighted varying degrees of access to water supply and sanitary sewage infrastructure, with notable discrepancies between regions. Additionally, supplementary graphical analyses unveiled nuanced patterns and correlations, shedding light on factors influencing sanitation disparities.</p>

**Conclusion:**

<p align="justify">In conclusion, this project offers a comprehensive exploration of sanitation conditions in Brazil, utilizing advanced data visualization techniques to uncover key insights. By providing detailed explanations and transparent methodologies, it serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders invested in improving sanitation infrastructure and addressing disparities across regions. Through continued analysis and data-driven interventions, strides can be made towards achieving equitable access to sanitation facilities for all residents of Brazil.</p>
