# Exploratory Analysis of the Sanitation Condition in Brazil

In this project, an exploratory analysis of data on sanitation conditions in the states of Brazil was developed. The main objective was to create a scatter plot, showing the relationship between the proportion of the population served with water supply and the proportion of the population served with sanitary sewage, considering all states (different colors) and the size of the population (size of the dots). Moreover, some more analyses, mainly graphical ones, were also performed.

Finally, you can follow the entire development of this project, as I explain step by step all the procedures that were used. The data were extracted from the National Confederation of Municipalities (CNM). url: &lt;https://www.cnm.org.br/municipios/registros/100151/todos>
